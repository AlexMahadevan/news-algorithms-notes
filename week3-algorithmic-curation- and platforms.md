## Platform Power and Algorithmic Content Curation

<p>At Facebook and Google, alorithms decide what we see when.</p>

### Google and Facebook main way people getting news

* 45% of U.S. adults get news on Facebook; 67% from social media
* More than half get news from Google
* Facebook and Google account for 70% of external traffic to news sites
* Power: Facebook single handedly boosted voter turnout by prioritizing news posts around November

### Search algorithms

* Google integrates news into search results and draws special attention to three news articles under the top story section
    * Which sources were popping up?
    * Washington Post, CNBC and Politico topped the list for "tax reform"
    * Only 12 news sources showed up the entire day
    * One local news outlet

### Trends algorithms

* What news showed up in Apple News?
    * Fox News, People and CNN topped this study
    * Most about celebrities and entertainment
    * Shows the makeup of hard news vs. soft news 

### Consequences of curation and platform algorithms

* Impact public opinion
* Influence voter turnout
* Impact whether people can form communities online
* Affect diversity of information exposure
* News organizations not getting same boost as others
    * This impacts the bottom ;ine

## Content Optimization and Metrics

<p>How can we maximize the reach of our news content online using algorithms?</p>

### Tools

* Chartbeat
* NewsWhip
* Parse.ly

### Approaches

* Healdine A/B testing
    * Testing algorithm feeds different headlines to readers to optimize around click-through rate
    * Could be images as well
    * Can break this down by demographics
        * Which headline is best at driving CTR for women?
* Recommendation widgets
* Recommend articles more likely to be clicked on based on the reder/demographic
    * Keep readers circulating — make pages sticky
    * Washington Posts's widget increases clicks 9%
* Timing
    * What's the optimal time to publish your piece of content?
    * Echobox: Uses algorithms to mine when your content will get the most attention.
    * Using algorithm to optimize against Google or Facebook's algorithm
    * Helps be more resonses to chanegs in Google or Facebook's algorithm
* Warning: Are you optimizing the right metric?

### Metrics

<p>You want to optimize the right metric! Are you going for clicks or engagement — or something totally different?</p>

* Depends on what data is available
    * Another way platforms exercise their power over 
* Should align with business model
    * If you're pushing subscriptions, you don't want to measure the number of retweets a story is getting. You might want to focus on repeat visit rate
* Should align with content
    * Content might succeed according to different metrics: viral vs. investigations to appeal for new subscribers or loyal users
    * Can't judge all content by the same yard stick. Think: What is this content supposed to do for our business or editorial strategy?

## Guest lecture: Tamara Charney

<p>Tamara Charney, managing director for personalization and curation at NPR, chats about algorithmic curation in public radio.</p>

### AI at NPR

<p>NPR optimizes its news curation — especially of podcasts — using a mix of AI and humans.</p>

* Job description — new role in the age of AI
    * Not the journalist in the room
    * Figure out how to use algorithms to get content to listeners
        * NPR One app
            * Pandora for news
            * Algorithm fits stories into buckets they have set up: national, then local, then mix of stories from NPR, local stations, podcasts, etc.
        * One who asks the questions to data scientists about what exactly these will do
    * Take the best decisions humans make about "driveway moments" and blending with the tracking and data behind algorithms

* How do they do it?
    * Humans listen to every audio story and make decisions about what role it plays for people, how long it will be relevant, etc.
    * They communicate this to algorithms

* Content mix
    * Main job of the algorithm is the localization piece
    * But also speaks to communities you identify with — podcasts help them do this
    * Algorithm will actually serve podcasts from opposing views!
    * But, nothing wrong with some bubble content

* What does curation algorithm optimize for?
    * Engagement — creating the stickiest experience
    * Engagement leads to donations and shows the AI and curators are giving people the news they need, the fun and serendipity they expect

### Advice for news organizations

<p>Clarify who you are and what you do for your readers</p>

* Algorithms are modern editorial tools
    * Dig down into the heart of what you want it to accomplish — not just clicks, engagement etc.
    * For the Penny Hoarder, MIYP might have trained the algorithm toward our aim

* How do you work with the actual data scientists behind an algorithm?
    * Facilitate conversation
    * Create new position between data scientists and editors — possibly a data journalist Who can translate jargon from both sides
