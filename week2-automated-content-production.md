## Automated Content Production

<p>This week, we’ll get into a lot more detail on automated content production, including how it works and is used by news organizations, as well as covering its benefits and limitations so you know when it might be appropriate to deploy.</p>

### Some examples

* Template for poll article
    * Markers for where data is plugged in, but also places for synonyms, etc.
* AP story on earnings report
    * Article is dry and straightforward but gets main point across
    * End of story provides data source and how it was created — transparency
* Usually you'll see hybrid articles in which humans do some reporting
* Washington Post U.S. election coverage
    * In 2012, the Post only covered 15% of congressional races — in 2016 they covered 100%
    * These were dynamic over the cource of election night
* Sweden's Klackspark automatically generated articles for all soccer games
    * Theybhave 14 sport reporters who pick amongst the auto articles for ones that could use more reporting

### Getting into the nitty gritty of automated content

#### Standard NLG (natural language generation) model

<p>Used to create the output in some of these examples</p>

* Document planning
    * What you want to communicate and how should you structure it? What's newsworthy and how should we lay it out?
* Microplanning
    * Word and syntax choice for sentences and phrases. What synonyms should we use?
* Realization
    * Grammar rules, making sure everything is grammatically correct. Conjugation, pluralization, capitalization

#### Other approaches

* Statistical techniques
    * Train lots of data. Don't use templates. Quality usually isn't as good as templates
* Summarization
    * Compressing a long article into a short summary.
    * Extractive: 10 sentence article, abstractive approach would extract two sentences and concatenate them
    * Abstractive: Can generate new texts that don't exist in the original article. More sophisticated. Not used as much
* Other media
    * Video, data, visualizations and bots
    * TreasuryIO bot
    * Der Spiegel sports graphics

#### Automation changes the way we work

* New tasks for people
    * Writing templates
    * Update tweak and edit
    * Monitoring to ensure reliability
* Role evolution
    * Skills, tasks and jobs evolve: writing, maintenance and supervising
    * New positions at the high and low end

## Benefits and Limitations of Automated Content

### Let's get to the benefits!

<p>SkyNet???</p>

#### Speed

* Specifically for breaking financial news
* LA Times quaqebot
    * Only takes a minute to log a earthquage
    * Speed important for safety reasons

#### Scale

* Same type of event can be covered over and over again; can do this across geographies
* Washington Post elections pages
    * Covered hundreds of races with automated pages and graphics that updated constantly
    * Scaled up from only 15%

#### Accuracy

* Algorithms don't make typos
* But: Example of company delisted from the stock exchange and misreporting the stock price change

#### Personalization

* Helps adapt writing to each individual reader
* New York Times best place to grow up — shows how your area compares to others

### Now let's look at limitations 

<p>It's not quite time to worry about SkyNet.</p>

#### Data access
    * Biggest limitation
    * Need to have structured data and knowledge basis 
    * Volume, quality and richness affects algorithms
    * Media companies need to look at getting exclusive data: sensor journalism, FOIA, etc.

#### Why and how?
    * Explaining these things requires higher-level thinking
    * Also require social udnerstanding

#### Lack social understanding
    * Cultural interpretations (theater reviews) very difficult
    * Algorithms might defame or libel someone unintentionally

#### Writing quality
    * Template-based approaches lack variability
    * People get bored reading

#### How to get around limitations

* Get people involved
* Authors write fragments of text controlled by data-driven if/then/else rules
    * Can write templates with data
    * Offloads some stuff to humans

## Guest Speaker: Carl-Gustav Linden

* People aren't going to pay for algorithmic news
    * But this will free up journalists to do stories that matter
    * Still, not going to be a business model

* Journalists can do more and more stuff themselves

* Don't call it "robot journalism", call it "washer machine journalism"

* Is a drone a robot?

* What makes a journalist human?
    * Passion is an important part of the business model because it belies engagement
    * News organiations should talk more about passion

* "We need real journalists who do real journalism."
    * We need to make journalists more human
